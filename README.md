# Multilateration in python
As part of an internship at DSO, I worked on a project that aims to carry out multilateration for mode AC and mode S messages. 
These messages are used extensively in Aeronautical communications and navigation.
<br>This repository houses mainly the client-side implementation for the project. A possible implementation of the server-side is also included.
